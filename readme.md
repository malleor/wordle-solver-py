### How to play the game in a terminal?

Run `python3` and run the challenge like so:

```
from wordle.solvers.interactive_solver import InteractiveSolver
from wordle.challenges.mock_challenge import MockChallenge
from wordle.main import *
from getpass import getpass
run_challenge(MockChallenge(getpass('set the challenge word: ')), InteractiveSolver())
```

After the prompt, ask someone to type in the challenge word and start solving the puzzle.
