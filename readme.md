### How to play the game in a terminal?

Run `python3` and run the challenge like so:

```
from wordle import *
from getpass import getpass
run_challenge(MockChallenge(getpass('set the challenge word: ')), InteractiveSolver())
```

After the prompt, ask someone to type in the challenge word and start solving the puzzle.
It may look like this:

```
>>> run_challenge(MockChallenge(getpass('set the challenge word: ')), InteractiveSolver())
set the challenge word:
guess the word: FINER
FINER 俱뫮잺 拘럺잺拘럺잺拘럺잺拘럺잺游릳
guess the word: TRUTH
TRUTH 俱뫮잺 拘럺잺游릳拘럺잺拘럺잺拘럺잺
guess the word: WORRY
WORRY 俱뫮잺 拘럺잺拘럺잺游릴游릳拘럺잺
guess the word: CARDS
CARDS 俱뫮잺 游릳游릳游릴拘럺잺游릳
guess the word: SCRAP
SCRAP 俱뫮잺 游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴

```

If you'd rather play alone, you can use a randomly selected challenge word.
After running `python3`, type:

```
from wordle import *
from getpass import getpass
run_challenge(RandomChallenge(), InteractiveSolver())
```
